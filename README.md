# Using a Webcam-Based Eye Tracker (ET) to Measure Saccadic Paradigms in Patients with Cognitive Impairment (CI)

Background: Eye Trackers (ETs) are advanced, high-resolution, external cameras that follow and measure eye movement. Tracking eye movement is particularly helpful in gaining insight into cognitive health. Studies that use ETs found that irregular ocular saccadic paradigms (such as slower and less accurate saccades) have strong correlations with Cognitive Impairment (CI). Treatments for CI can be more effective at earlier stages, making early diagnosis of CI is crucial. ETs could be used to provide a provisional diagnosis of CI; however, an ETs can cost up to $40,000 excluding software, limiting accessibility and feasibility of research in the area, a primary aim of this research.

Methods: In this research, an image-classification convolutional neural network (CNN) was investigated using images captured from a webcam to mimic an ET with similar reliability. My webcam-based ET calibrated itself by displaying a dot and asking the user to follow the dot  as it moved. The webcam captured images as the dot moved and recorded the position of the dot every time it captured an image. Approximately 750 images of the eyes were captured; 76% of these images were used  to train the model while 24% of the images were used for validation. 

Results: Accuracy levels produced using this CNN webcam-based ET were comparable to existing technologies, with errors typically ranging from 1.77% to 3.83%. 

Future Steps: Future work includes a multiple webcam approach which will allow for minor face movements and reduce errors further. The immediate next step would then be testing the webcam-based ET in a clinical setting on patients with mild cognitive impairment to determine saccadic paradigms.
